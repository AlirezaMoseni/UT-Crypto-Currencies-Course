**Project 2: Smart Contracts and Distributed Ledger**

In this project we design a decentralized ledger system that can record people's debts and claims.The server side of this project is handled using a smart contract written in solidity language and registered in the Etherium network. The user side of the project is also written in JavaScript and is executed by the user's browser. Then it is connected to the server through web3.js and provides the necessary services.
