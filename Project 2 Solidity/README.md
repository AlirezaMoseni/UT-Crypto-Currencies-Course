### **Project 2: Block chain ledger**

The goal of this project is to design a decentralized system that can record people's debts and claims. Actually a decentralized example of a ledger. We are going to design and implement a decentralized system that determines who each person owes and how much, without the need for a third party organization to be involved.

The server side of this project is handled using a smart contract written in solidity language and registered in the Etherium network. The user side of the project is also written in JavaScript and is executed by the user's browser. Then it is connected to the server through web3.js and provides the necessary services.
